    <h1>Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) Details</h1>
    <h2>General Description</h2>
    <p>
        The platypus is a unique, semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. It has a distinctive duck-bill, beaver-like tail, and webbed feet. It is one of the few venomous mammals, with males having a venomous spur on their hind feet.
    </p>
    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Length: 38 to 60 cm (15 to 24 inches)</li>
        <li>Weight: Around 3 to 5 pounds</li>
        <li>Fur: Dense waterproof fur, dark to light brown with lighter underfur and white patches under the eyes</li>
        <li>Bill: Soft, covered with electroreceptors to detect prey underwater</li>
        <li>Limbs: Webbed front feet for swimming, partially webbed hind feet for steering</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
    <p>
        Platypuses inhabit freshwater rivers, streams, lakes, and farm dams in eastern Australia, from tropical Queensland to Tasmania. They build burrows in riverbanks and are mostly nocturnal.
    </p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>
        The platypus is carnivorous, feeding on aquatic invertebrates such as insect larvae, annelid worms, freshwater shrimp, and crayfish (yabby). It hunts underwater using its bill's electroreceptors and stores food in cheek pouches to eat at the surface.
    </p>
    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nocturnal and solitary</li>
        <li>Spends up to 12 hours daily foraging for food</li>
        <li>Can stay underwater for up to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Males use venomous spurs for defense</li>
        <li>Females lay eggs in burrows and nurse young for several months</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the few egg-laying mammals (monotremes)</li>
        <li>Has a lower body temperature (~32Â°C) than most mammals</li>
        <li>Has electroreceptors in its bill to detect prey</li>
        <li>Featured on the Australian 20-cent coin</li>
    </ul>
